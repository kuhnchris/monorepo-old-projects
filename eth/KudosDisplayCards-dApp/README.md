## What is this?
This dApp enables the creation of profile cards to display your Kudos Swag to other people in the Kudos Metasphere.

## Why does this exist?
Basically I needed some experience with web3.js and associated libraries, so I found myself a purpose to do that. And that's it.

## Does this fulfill any purpose?
No. Definitly not. All this basically does is showcasing a number of tools and functions and how they interact with each other and can be abstracted.

## So, tell me, what is in this dApp?
- ~~require.js~~
- octokit/rest
- knockout.js
- html2canvas
- web3js
- webpack
- typescript
- 3box
- a custom-written web3 wrapper for future projects

## I'm fascinated by this, how can I help this dApp gittin' good?
... what are you on about? Fork it. Improve it. For all I care, steal it and call it your own.

## How can I use this?
```
git clone <path to this repo>
cd KudosDisplayCards-dApp
npm i
npm start
```

If `npm start` doesn't open your browser, navigate to http://localhost:8080
