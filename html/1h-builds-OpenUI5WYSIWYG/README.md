# 1 Hour Builds

This is a short mini-series I am conducting doing 1 hour of work on a topic and then putting it on the side.

This time we, triggered by BUILD.ME's shutdown, attempted to create a bit of boiler-plate code for a possible WYSIWYG editor, and how hard it is to use reflections to actually grab properties via javascript.

# Status

We managed to build a little HTML page, added the bootstrap code and some initial code to show-case how to implement a property-trigger, a object selection and a object initialization.

Naturally this needs to be improved a bit, and also, for actual use, base it on XML and XMLViews. But the basic code should work. 

Maybe in one of the next builds we will try to dynamically generate the XML required by the XMLView with hotloading it after every change. We will see.
