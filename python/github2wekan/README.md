# Github 2 Wekan
This tool allows you to write GraphQL queries and 
import the result into Wekan. May require a bit of 
rewrite to be useful for generic use-cases, but 
works out of the box for my purposes.

### Install
```bash
pip install -r < requirements.txt
```

### Execution
**Make sure you finished editing the source 
and create a config.py!**
```bash
python github2wekan.py
```
