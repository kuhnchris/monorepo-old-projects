This repository show-cases some tools to generate XSD files from the JSDoc data to help support XMLView development outside of WebIDE.

### Usage / Use-Case

Currently I'm trying to use VSCode with XML Tools & XML (RedHat), as well as XML Complete. Sadly with the SAP-provided XSD there is no way to use them properly due to circular dependencies.
